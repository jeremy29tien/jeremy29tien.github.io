I’m a Machine Learning PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://anayebi.github.io" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Aran Nayebi</a> and <a href="https://zicokolter.com" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Zico Kolter</a>. I’m interested in AI safety and alignment, particularly for agentic systems.</p> <p>Formerly, I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, where I did research in the area of human-AI interaction while advised by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~anca/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Anca Dragan</a>.</p> <p>Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite <a href="http://reddit.com" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">subreddit</a>. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prof_pic.jpg</code> and put it in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">img/</code> folder.</p> <p>Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">profile</code> property of the YAML header of your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_pages/about.md</code>. Edit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_bibliography/papers.bib</code> and Jekyll will render your <a href="/al-folio/publications/">publications page</a> automatically.</p> <p>Link to your social media connections, too.
