Hi! I'm a Machine Learning PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Aran Nayebi](https://anayebi.github.io) and [Prof. Zico Kolter](https://zicokolter.com). I'm interested in AI safety and alignment, particularly for agentic systems. 

Formerly, I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, where I did research in the area of human-AI interaction while advised by [Prof. Anca Dragan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~anca/).

REMOVE: Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
